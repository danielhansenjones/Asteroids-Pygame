# 🚀 Asteroids Game

## Overview
This is my first game project created as part of my learning journey through BootDev. The game is a classic Asteroids clone implemented in Python using Pygame, offering a fun way to practice Python programming concepts.

## 🎮 Gameplay
In this game, you control a spaceship navigating through an asteroid field. The objective is to survive as long as possible while shooting and destroying asteroids. Be careful though - if your ship collides with an asteroid, it's game over!

### Controls:
- `W` - Move forward
- `A` - Rotate left
- `D` - Rotate right
- `S` - Move backward
- `SPACE` - Shoot

## 🔧 Technical Features
- Object-oriented design with proper inheritance
- Pygame sprite groups for efficient game object management
- Vector-based movement and physics
- Collision detection
- Dynamic asteroid spawning system
- Asteroid splitting mechanics

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame 2.6.1
